I had to see for myself
I did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I‚Äôm not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home.
But I‚Äôm just so curious, I can‚Äôt help myself. I think I‚Äôll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?
